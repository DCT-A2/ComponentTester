# The code for the component tester
###### This is the STM32CubeMX project for the component tester. It can be compiled using the makefile, then uploaded to the STM32 with `st-flash --reset write build/SPI-TEST.bin 0x8000000`
This is currently a work in progress. Doesn't have the ability to test components yet
